                <p>
                I am <b>Blerand Ismaili</b>, new and passionate full stack developer. I live in Palm Beach and as you
                might have guessed beach walks are my favorite.

                I come from Albania a small but amazing country where I studied and worked as a <i>journalist</i> before
                moving to USA where I got my second bachelor on Business Administration

                Programing became my preference while I was teaching it to high school students in Boston and so I
                joined <b> University of Miami Bootcamp</b> to persue my dream.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have experienced many career before such as journalist, edtior, manager, teacher and lately operations
                assistant.
                I believe life is a challenge where we contantly have to push ourself to do better and to be better.
                That is the reason why I always focus
                on education and life experiences. Both great tool to learn, explorer and challege my mind.
