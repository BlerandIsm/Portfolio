                <p>
                I am <b>Blerand Ismaili</b>, new and passionate full stack developer. I live in Palm Beach and as you
                might have guessed beach walks are my favorite.

                I come from Albania a small but amazing country where I studied and worked as a <i>journalist</i> before
                moving to USA where I got my second bachelor on Business Administration

                Programing became my preference while I was teaching it to high school students in Boston and so I
                joined <b> University of Miami Bootcamp</b> to persue my dream.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have experienced many career before such as journalist, edtior, manager, teacher and lately operations
                assistant.
                I believe life is a challenge where we contantly have to push ourself to do better and to be better.
                That is the reason why I always focus
                on education and life experiences. Both great tool to learn, explorer and challege my mind.

                        This was my first website build with the help of my tutor. It is an interacting website for a gym website where people can sing in and join. It was made with HTML and CSS.

                    <p>
                        Horieson project was another HTML and CSS project that I worked on. I was given a broken code with many issues and problem and I fixed it to make a functional, user friendly website for our client.
